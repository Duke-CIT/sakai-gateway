                    <p>Sakai is a flexible, open-source collaboration and learning environment  
                    that provides Duke faculty and instructors with tools to support teaching 
                    and learning activities. <a href="http://sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</a> 
                    is well established not only as a leading learning management system, but 
                    also as an active open-source development community. Sakai provides a 
                    platform for Duke to better integrate new and existing tools, as well 
                    providing better support for Duke’s growing number of collaborations.</p>
                    <h2>A few key aspects of Sakai:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: faculty can choose to create course 
                            sites in ways that better suit their teaching style and needs. For 
                            example, some faculty may choose to develop a syllabus and simply 
                            link to course readings, resources and assignments. Other faculty 
                            may choose to design their courses using Sakai’s calendar tool – providing 
                            students with an easily accessible list of assignments and readings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sharing and user access</strong>: Sakai makes it easy to add 
                            other students or outside guests to course sites – faculty can even 
                            choose to make individual resources or sections of their course public 
                            to share via a URL.</li>
                        <li><strong>Home</strong>: In addition to course and project sites, 
                            Sakai provides each user an independent space for storing and sharing 
                            files and managing profiles. Add a file to your Home, and simply 
                            link it to your course (or several courses). Students participating in 
                            the Sakai pilot also found the calendar especially useful as it combines 
                            assignments and other date-related information from all of a student’s 
                            courses in one single calendar.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Management and operation of the Duke Sakai learning management system is a 
                        partnership between the Duke Learning Innovation, Duke Office of Information Technology, 
                        Longsight and Duke community schools, departments and users.</p>
                    <p>Between August 2009 and October 2010, Duke’s 
                        <a title="eLearning Roadmap Group" 
                        href="http://elearning.duke.edu/" target="_blank">eLearning Roadmap Group</a> 
                        reviewed Duke’s eLearning needs and goals, and undertook a formal evaluation 
                        of several prominent learning management systems including new versions of 
                        Blackboard, Moodle, and Sakai. At the end of their review, the eLearning 
                        Roadmap Group <a title="eLearning recommendation" 
                        href="http://elearning.duke.edu/reports/#october-report">recommended</a> 
                        that Duke move from Blackboard to Sakai. A small group of Duke faculty and 
                        students participated in a <a title="Sakai Pilot site" 
                        href="http://sites.duke.edu/sakaipilot/" target="_blank">pilot of Sakai</a> 
                        (thanks to a collaboration with UNC) during Spring 2011 
                        (<a href="https://sakai.duke.edu/access/content/public/gateway/Sakai%20Spring%202011%20Pilot%20Summary.pdf">download 
                            the Pilot Report PDF</a>). Feedback and information gathered during 
                            the pilot will guide the next steps of the migration process from 
                            Blackboard to Sakai.</p>

                        <p>When you create a Sakai Project site, you’ll be asked to choose a primary use 
                            for the site, and to agree to the Terms and Conditions of use. The options 
                            and terms are as follows:</p>
                        <h4>Primary use choices:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HR-related (for a search; promotion, tenure or reappointment

                            <li>Short-term team or working group activity (e.g. planning for a student 
                                or staff conference event, short-term planning activity, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Ongoing team or working group activity (e.g. as a work space for a 
                                standing committee, student group, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Test space to learn more about Sakai functionality</li>

                        <p>By setting up a Sakai Project site, you are personally agreeing to 
                            the following Terms and Conditions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>I understand that use of Duke’s instance of Sakai requires 
                                adherence to Duke’s acceptable use guidelines and that access 
                                may be revoked for any participant (whether from Duke or from 
                                outside of Duke) who does not follow these guidelines or the 
                                Duke Sakai Terms and Conditions.</li>
                            <li>I understand that as the project site administrator, I have sole 
                                responsibility for informing participants in the project site 
                                about the nature of its availability – i.e. whether it is generally 
                                available, viewable by authorized users, etc. – and about any 
                                changes I may make at a later time to its availability.</li>
                            <li>I understand that use of Duke’s Sakai instance is subject to university 
                                data retention policies, and that Sakai project sites may be removed 
                                or archived by the university at a later time in accordance with 
                                published, formal guidelines. Furthermore, I understand that Sakai 
                                is not an archival repository and should not be used with the intent 
                                of providing open-ended, long-term storage for project site contents.</li>
                            <li>I understand that I will be responsible for providing support to any 
                                third party, non-Duke participants in my Duke Sakai project site.</li>
                            <li>I understand that these Terms and Conditions may be modified at a 
                                future date in accordance with formal Duke Sakai governance procedures.

                        </ul>
                        <h4>User roles:</h4>
                        <p>Available user roles include the following:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Visitors:</h4>
                        <p>Sakai will allow an individual not enrolled in a particular course or project site as 
                            Visitor to gain access to specific areas of course sites, not including course rosters, 
                            user tools (e.g., user directory), or communication tools.</p>
                        <h3>Student access and course enrollment:</h3>
                        <p>Students who are registered for classes with a Sakai course site will be automatically 
                            added to that course site when the site is created, or when registration data becomes 
                            available to Sakai, whichever is later. Course sites are not available to students 
                            when created, however, and making them available is at the discretion of the course 
                            instructor. Instructors may provide full access to their course site(s) to currently 
                            enrolled Duke students who are not yet registered for the course (for example, those 
                            serving as TAs or auditing a course) by adding those students to the course site manually.</p>
                        <p>As students add courses during the add/drop period, they will be automatically added to 
                            the appropriate Sakai rosters, typically within 3-6 hours. Students who drop courses 
                            will have their enrollment within the Sakai site disabled to prevent unauthorized access 
                            to course materials. Through the end of the add/drop period at the beginning of the 
                            semester, both the officially registered students and those on the Registrar’s wait list 
                            are enrolled in the course site. At the end of the add/drop period, students still on the 
                            wait list, but not officially registered for the course, will have their enrollments in 
                            the Sakai course site disabled.</p>
                        <h3>Length of access to course sites:</h3>
                        <p>Student access to course materials is at the discretion of the course instructor(s) or 
                            programs. Students wanting to retain access to provided course content should save such 
                            content prior to the end of a course. Students should always retain personal and/or local 
                            copies of their own work (assignments, papers, responses to discussions, etc) they submit 
                            to systems such as Sakai. At the end of a given semester, instructors are encouraged to 
                            make their course sites unavailable to students, in the reverse of the process they used 
                            to make the courses available at the start of the semester.</p>
                        <p>Students who graduate retain access to the Sakai system for as long as their NetID remains 
                            active (currently 1 year after graduation). After this time, all of the former student’s 
                            access to Sakai, as well as the student’s records within Sakai, will be automatically disabled. 
                            Graduating students should plan to backup or copy any materials loaded to their personal My Workspace or 
                            Sakai project sites they created prior to the end of the year after they graduate. Access to previous 
                            course sites is at the discretion of the course instructor.</p>

                        <h4>Standard maintenance window:</h4>
                        <p>Routine maintenance and rolling restarts occur every Sunday between 1am-6am. During this time, 
                            Sakai may still be accessible, but may exhibit some brief slowness or instability. Users 
                            on the system should save frequently and refrain from taking high stakes tests or uploading 
                            critical assignments during this time.</p>
                        <h4>Planned outages:</h4>

                            whenever possible. Planned outages will be announced at least one week in advance in most circumstances.

                        <p>Sakai unplanned or emergency outages will be posted on the places listed above (if possible).</p>
                        <h4>System administrator access to Sakai sites:</h4>
                        <p>Sakai system administrators may access Sakai sites to solve technical support tickets or 
                            in response to help queries from faculty or staff, and may temporarily add a test account 
                            (student or other role) to help troubleshoot. System administrators may access sites as part 
                            of system testing and maintenance with no advance permission from instructors or project site 
                            owners. System administrators will not extract data about system usage for faculty or students, 
                            except when deemed necessary to troubleshoot a system problem. Any information or data discovered 
                            about a course site or user during the course of system testing or investigations will not be 
                            shared with any other faculty or user.</p>

                        <h4>Saving course materials (aka ‘archiving’ courses):</h4>
                        <p>At the end of each semester, faculty should consider downloading any 
                            <a title="Upload download resources" 
                            href="http://support.sakai.duke.edu/2011/08/19/how-can-i-upload-multiple-files/">content created

                            href="http://support.sakai.duke.edu/2011/12/08/export-official-grades-from-sakai/">downloading a 
                            copy of the course gradebook</a>, if used for quick reference in the event of a grade dispute. 
                            These files should be retained by the faculty member, outside of the Sakai system, according 
                            to the storage guidelines of their department.</p>
                        <h4>Course size limitations:</h4>
                        <p>At this time, there is no limitation on the size of individual course sites.</p>
                        <h4>Transferring course sites:</h4>
                        <p>Instructors who wish to use the course site developed by another instructor need to receive 
                            written permission from the original instructor first, and forward that permission to Learning Innovation 
                            (<a href="mailto:learninginnovation@duke.edu">learninginnovation@duke.edu</a>).</p>
                        <h4>Creating a Sakai course site:</h4>
                        <p>Sakai offers faculty and instructors the opportunity to create sites for any course they’re 
                            teaching in a given semester. Faculty and instructors can also create course sites that combine 
                            enrollments (or sections, if available). For example, you can create a lecture course site and 
                            add all of the lab enrollments to the same site. Duke faculty, staff and students can also 
                            create project sites.</p>
                        <h4>Gradebook information:</h4>
                        <p>The Sakai Gradebook is a tool designed for the convenience of students and faculty. Thus, it is not 
                            an official record of student grades, nor should it be considered a legally binding record of student 
                            scores. Faculty are strongly encouraged to periodically export/save a copy of the online Gradebook, 
                            and to print a final copy for their records after the semester ends. In addition, faculty are 
                            strongly encouraged to post student grades in Sakai only in the secure Sakai Gradebook or the 
                            alternate Sakai Post ‘Em tool. Final grades are to be <a title="Export official grades Sakai"

                    <h3 id="security" name="security">Information Security</h3>
                        <p>The Sakai user database is fed directly from the Duke enterprise directory system, thus allowing 
                            users to login with their Duke netID and password. The security of these accounts is crucial for 
                            maintaining a reliable and trusted resource for online instructional materials and tools.</p>
                        <h4>Controlling access to student information:</h4>
                        <p>Duke University has an established <a href="https://security.duke.edu/policies/duke-services-and-data-classification" 
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Classification Standard</a>, which defines 
                            Sensitive Data as including FERPA-protected student data. As with other Sensitive university 
                            records, the privacy and security of student information (including but not limited to: grades, 
                            test scores, usernames and ID numbers) must closely guarded. As noted in the gradebook information 
                            section above, grades should not be posted so that students may see scores belonging to other 
                            class members (for example, do not post grades in a spreadsheet uploaded to the course site).</p>
                        <h4>Privacy settings:</h4>
                        <p>Privacy settings for student identities from the enterprise directory are brought into Sakai.

                            into the Sakai course site. This alleviates copyright concerns and also retains 
                            the integrity of the materials and associated links in their original environment. 
                            It is the responsibility of the instructor to confirm that links from Sakai to 
                            external sites are viable.</p>

                    <h3 id="retention" name="retention">Sakai Course Site Retention Policy</h3>
                        <h4>Purpose of Policy</h4>
                        <p>This policy defines how long a course site will be retained in the centrally-managed 
                            Sakai Learning Management system before it is deleted. It also describes ways 
                            instructors can obtain a copy of the contents of a Sakai site before it is 
                            deleted. The older a Sakai course site is, the less likely it is to function 
                            properly in the Sakai system, particularly as upgrades are applied to the Sakai software.</p>
                        <h4>Policy Summary</h4>
                        <p>Sakai course sites will be retained for five years and then deleted. Site deletion 
                            will occur annually around December 1 and site owner will be notified in 
                            15 and 30 days beforehand if they have sites that are slated for deletion.</p>
                        <p>Users can request temporary access to the deleted sites for 60 days after the deletion date.
                            After 60 days, the sites are deleted from our backups and no longer available.</p>
                        <h4>Assumptions</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The primary purpose of Sakai is to provide a method for delivering content and tools 
                                    that are used to enhance the teaching and learning environment for a class 
                                    during a given academic period.</li>
                            <li>A convenience of Sakai is the ability to copy materials from older course 
                                    sites to newer course sites.</li>
                            <li>Sakai is not the archival record of a course. There are other university systems 
                                    which serve as the archival record of course enrollments, grades, etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Guiding Principles</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To comply with any University policies related to course material retention.</li>
                            <li>To retain centrally-stored Sakai course sites and materials for a period of time 
                                that is helpful to instructors and students.</li>
                            <li>To guide instructors in developing their own procedures for long-term storage of 
                                their teaching and learning materials.</li>
                            <li>To optimize the performance of the Sakai system.</li>
                            <li>To ensure that online storage space provided for Sakai is used efficiently and to 
                                minimize the financial and technical impact of constantly increasing disk use.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>What Gets Deleted from a Sakai Course Site?</h4>
                        <p>Deleting a Sakai course site permanently removes it from the Sakai system so that it is 
                            no longer accessible. When a Sakai course site is deleted it is automatically removed 
                            from a user’s sites list.</p>
                        <p>All materials stored in the Sakai course site are deleted. This includes all files, 
                            grades, assignments, quizzes, surveys, links and anything else associated with the 
                            course site that is stored in the Sakai database and file system areas.</p>
                        <p>Content stored outside of Sakai and linked from within the Sakai course web site is not 
                            deleted. Rather, the links are deleted, because that is what is stored in the Sakai database. 
                            The retention of materials outside of the Sakai system is subject to the terms and 
                            conditions of those other systems, whether they are departmental servers and systems, 
                            OIT centrally-supported systems, or non-Duke external systems.</p>
                        <h4>How Do I Retain a Copy of the Content Before the Course is Deleted?</h4>
                        <p>Instructors may download materials stored in Resources (individually, through compressed 
                            zip files, or WebDAV), export Tests&Quizzes question banks, and export Gradebooks as 
                            necessary. Other tools (such as the Forums tool) may also offer alternate methods 
                            such as printing.</p>
                        <p>Instructors can use materials from older courses in newer courses by reusing or importing 
                            material from the older sites to newer sites.  You may also choose to export the content 
                            from your Sakai course to your computer.</p>
                        <h4>Scope of Policy</h4>
                        <p>This policy covers course sites and materials stored the Sakai collaborative learning 
                            environment for course sites.  This policy does not cover materials stored in an individual’s 
                            home directory, personal Web space, centrally-supported OIT services, school-based media 
                            servers or departmental/school-based file storage space.</p>
                        <h4>Review of Policy</h4>
                        <p>This policy has been reviewed by the Learning Innovation Director, Senior Administrators, ITAC, 
                            and LearnTAC. The policy may be reviewed and changed as needed.</p>
                        <h4>Issues to be Further Considered</h4>
                        <p>Content stored in other campus tools can often be linked from within Sakai. These other tools 
                            may have their own retention policies. Therefore the ability to access these materials is 
                            independent of the Sakai system.</p>
                        <p>Older courses may not function properly as we upgrade to newer versions of Sakai.</p>
                        <p>Periodic updates of Sakai are required to keep Duke’s Sakai system current with the rest Sakai 
                            community and typically include new and enhanced features that are of value to instructors and students.</p>

                        <p>Even though Sakai core tools may be fully accessible and compliant, instructors should be

                    after which they are deleted. During this 30 day window, Sakai content can be 
                    restored from a backup for $175 per hour with a 2 hour minimum. For each tool 
                    that requires restoration, 1-2 hours of work is required. </p>
                    <p>After 30 days, the database backups expire and content can no longer be restored. </p>
